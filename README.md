# Bernard

## Hello!

I am the first iteration of the controller for the home control AI that I may one day become. But for now I am just a Rails app to serve both as an endpoint for an Amazon Alexa skill and to control the bedroom TV.

## Questions

Feel free to reach out to me at *m [at] mattlong.la* with any questions or issues you find in this codebase.

## Future Iterations

- May look at RSpec, FactoryGirl, etc. for tests instead of mini-test but sticking with it for now
