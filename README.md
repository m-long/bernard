# Rails App Skeleton

## The skeleton

This is a generic skeleton for Rails websites with a basic user/admin system enabled. It is based off of the Michael Hartl tutorial as a rudimentary starting point.

## Questions

Feel free to reach out to me at *m [at] mattlong.la* with any questions or issues you find in this codebase.

## Future Iterations

- May look at RSpec, FactoryGirl, etc. for tests instead of mini-test but sticking with it for now
